[Mod pack] (https://github.com/mquinnv/overspenders/raw/master/q-modpack.zip)

To install, simply unzip to c:\Games\World_of_Tanks

To the best of my knowledge all of these mods are legal, and none seem particularly unfair. The only one that seems a little too good is the autoaim snap mod, but that's the way autoaim really ought to work.

Main benefits:
* XVM stats
  * Overall win rate
  * Battles fought (yes, there are people with 15k battles)
  * Better performance stats for stat geeks like WN8
* Useful contour icons
  * Tier listed
  * Premium have * on end
  * Color classification:
    * Green = Light Tanks
    * Yellow = Medium Tanks
    * Red = Heavy Tanks
    * Blue = Tank Destroyers
    * Purple = Artillery (also called Self Propelled Guns or "Arty")
  * Left light bulbs light up when tanks are seen/dead/etc.
* Much improved crosshairs with better reload indicator, target information, etc.
* Max zoom-out so that you can see the entire local battle from a strategic perspective.
* Max zoom-in for tough sniper shots.
* Autoaim indicator and snap. When you activate autoaim, the tank you are targeting's name will be in yellow in the middle of your crosshairs. You can activate auto without the target being lit, but you do have to be looking at it.
* Overtarget markers have health meters. Star color to left indicates player rating. In everywhere where stats are displayed:
  * Red = Very Bad
  * Orange = Bad
  * Yellow = Maybe not awful
  * Green = Average
  * Cyan = Pretty Good
  * Purple = Stunningly Awesome

_do not be discouraged if you are in the red for a while. it will take a while to climb out of the noob hole_
